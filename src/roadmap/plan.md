# Roadmap


1. Create a new React app using create-react-app.

2. Install any necessary dependencies, such as axios or fetch.

3. Create a new folder called services in your app's root directory. This folder will contain any files that interact with your API.

4. Create a new file called dictionary-api.js in the services folder. This file will contain functions that interact with the dictionary API.

5. Define a function called fetchDefinition(word) inside dictionary-api.js that takes a word parameter and returns a promise that resolves to the definition of the word.

6. Use the fetch() or axios library to make a network request to the API endpoint and extract the definition from the response data. You can use a try/catch block to handle any errors that might occur during the network request or data parsing.

7. Export the fetchDefinition function from dictionary-api.js.

8. Create a new folder called components in your app's root directory. This folder will contain any React components you create.

9. Create a new file called SearchInput.js in the components folder. This file will contain a React component that allows users to search for a word.

10. Define a functional component called SearchInput that takes a prop called onSearch, which is a callback function that will be called when the user submits the form with a search term.

11. Inside the component, use the useState hook to manage the state of the search input. Use the onChange event to update the state when the user types in the input.

12. Define a handleSubmit function that will be called when the user clicks the submit button or presses Enter. This function prevents the default form submission behavior, and calls the onSearch callback with the current value of the search input.

13. Render a form with an input field and a submit button. Bind the value of the input field to the state of the search input, and attach an onChange event listener to the input field that calls the handleInputChange function when the user types in the input.

14. When the user submits the form, the handleSubmit function is called, which in turn calls the onSearch callback with the current value of the search input.

15. Create a new file called Definition.js in the components folder. This file will contain a React component that displays the definition of a word.

16. Define a functional component called Definition that takes a prop called word, which is the word whose definition will be displayed.

17. Inside the component, use the useState hook to manage the state of the definition. Use the useEffect hook to make a network request to the API endpoint when the component mounts.

18. Use the fetchDefinition function from dictionary-api.js to fetch the definition of the word. Set the definition state with the result.

19. Render the definition state inside the component.

20. Export the SearchInput and Definition components from their respective files.

21. Render the SearchInput component inside your app's main component.

22. When the user submits the form, call the fetchDefinition function and pass it the search term. Update the state of the Definition component with the result.

23. Render the Definition component with the search term as a prop.
